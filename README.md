# HeartFailurePrediction
A Machine Learning method to predict heart failure, using Cleveland data from U. California, Irvine.

data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/
processed.cleveland.data.

Other datasets could be used, but have a lot of missing data.

This code includes:

Defining the problem: trying to predict heart failure from 14 predictors.

Data cleaning: e.g. deleting missing data

Data scaling and normalising

Feature selection

Transforming to remove correlations with PCA 

Model comparison and selection

Hyperparameter tuning

Presentation of the results, including model AUC ROC (Area Under Curve: Receiver-Operator Curve), confusion matrix and more.
